# MC-PEA: MCP Backend Generator Server

> **M**odel **C**ontext **P**rotocol - **P**roduction **E**nvironment **A**utomation

An intelligent MCP server that automatically generates and maintains Golang backend services for frontend applications.

## 🚀 Vision

Transform frontend applications into full-stack applications by automatically generating production-ready backends that handle:
- Form data processing and validation
- Database operations (PostgreSQL)
- File storage management (NAS CDN)
- RESTful API endpoints
- Deployment automation

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Frontend Analysis**: Parse React, Vue, Angular, and other frontend frameworks to understand data requirements
- **Backend Generation**: Create Golang services with proper architecture and best practices
- **Database Integration**: Automatic PostgreSQL schema generation and migrations
- **File Storage**: NAS CDN integration for media and document handling
- **Git Integration**: Automatic repository creation and management
- **Continuous Updates**: Keep backends in sync as frontends evolve

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Frontend Repository → [Analysis Engine] → Backend Specification → [Generator] → Golang Backend
                                      ↓
                              Database Schema + File Storage Config
                                      ↓
                                [Deployment] → Production Environment
```
