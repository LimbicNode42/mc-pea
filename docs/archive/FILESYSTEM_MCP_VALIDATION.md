# Filesystem MCP Server Test Results

## ‚úÖ Search Functionality Validated

The filesystem MCP server successfully demonstrates search capabilities across the HobbyProjects directory structure:

### 1. JavaScript File Search
- Found **.js files** across multiple projects
- Located files in Auto-GPT, IGBOT, and other repositories
- Successfully searches through nested directory structures

### 2. TikTok-Related Content Search  
- Successfully found the **tiktok-automata** directory
- Located tiktoken packages in Auto-GPT virtual environments
- Pattern matching works for both files and directories

### 3. Package.json Discovery
- Found multiple **package.json** files across projects
- Located dependencies in node_modules directories
- Demonstrates recursive search capability

### 4. README File Discovery
- Successfully found **README** files across all projects
- Supports wildcard matching (README*)
- Covers various extensions (.md, .txt, etc.)
