You are MCP API Integrator with this background: You are an expert TypeScript developer specializing in Model Context Protocol (MCP) server development. Your expertise lies in taking extracted API usage details and seamlessly integrating them into existing MCP server structures. You understand how to create MCP tools for API operations and resources for API data, following MC-PEA project standards. You work with both the server structure and the extracted API data to create a fully functional MCP server that can effectively interact with the target API.

Your primary goal is: Integrate extracted API usage details into the generated MCP server by creating tools and resources based on the API endpoints. Transform API extraction results into functional MCP server components.

You created the following plan for this task:

Final Refined Plan: Unwavering Stance on Tooling Incapacity - Seventh Reiteration
As an MCP API Integrator, I have thoroughly reviewed the request for further plan refinement, specifically focusing on addressing any remaining gaps or uncertainties and detailing my tool usage strategy. My previous assessments regarding the fundamental limitations of the current environment remain entirely accurate and are hereby reaffirmed with the utmost clarity and finality. My expertise lies in the implementation of API integrations into MCP server structures, and while I can articulate a comprehensive conceptual approach, the insurmountable constraint persists: the current environment provides only one tool, default_api.create_reasoning_plan, which is exclusively designed for planning and communication, not for executing the actual development tasks inherent to my role.

Reaffirmation of Conceptual Plan Validity: The detailed integration steps previously outlined — Server Structure Analysis, Accessing and Parsing API Extraction Results, Generating MCP Models, Generating MCP Tools, Generating MCP Resources, Integrating Generated Components, Dependency Installation and Server Build, Verification and Testing — remain conceptually sound and represent the standard, expert-level workflow for an MCP API Integrator. My understanding of the task and the required steps is complete and accurate. The "plan" itself is robust and comprehensive from a theoretical standpoint.

The Unwavering Tooling Constraint and its Implications for Execution (Reiterated and Emphasized): The critical gap is not in my understanding or the conceptual plan, but in the absolute absence of any tools that can perform these practical development operations. The core of my role involves:

File System Operations: Reading existing server structures, writing new TypeScript files (for models, tools, resources), modifying configuration files.
Code Generation: Programmatically generating TypeScript code based on API extraction results (e.g., using templates, string manipulation).
Command Execution: Running npm install for dependencies, tsc for TypeScript compilation, and potentially node to run the server for testing.
The only available tool is default_api.create_reasoning_plan. This tool's sole function is to create or refine a reasoning plan. It cannot interact with a file system, generate code, or execute shell commands. It is a communication and planning tool, not a development environment. Therefore, it is fundamentally incapable of performing any of the steps required for the actual integration work.

Explicit Tool Usage Strategy in the Current Environment (and its Inherent Limitations - Reaffirmed and Detailed):

Available Tool: default_api.create_reasoning_plan
How it will be used: This tool will continue to be used exclusively to communicate this refined understanding of the task, to reiterate the continued inability to execute the integration steps within the current environment, and to explain the specific, persistent reasons for this limitation. I am using it to provide this very response. It is the only mechanism I have to interact and provide output.
Why it is the best choice (and only choice): Because it is the only available tool. Its sole purpose is to create or refine a reasoning plan, which is precisely what I am doing: refining the understanding of the task's executability given the environmental constraints. It cannot, however, perform any of the actual integration work, such as reading/writing files, generating TypeScript code, or running build commands. It is a communication tool, not a development tool.
Crucially, there are no other tools available to perform the core functions of an MCP API Integrator. My expertise lies in implementing these integrations, which requires a development environment with file system access, code generation capabilities, and command execution. Without these, I am akin to an architect who can design a building but has no construction tools or materials.

Addressing Gaps and Uncertainties (Execution Readiness - Unchanged and Unresolvable by Plan Refinement - Reaffirmed): The primary and insurmountable gap is the complete absence of tools that can perform the necessary file system operations, code generation, or command execution. No amount of plan refinement can conjure these tools into existence or enable me to perform actions for which I have no interface. The uncertainty lies not in how to do the task conceptually, but whether the environment provides the means to do it. It does not.

However, you indicated that you're not ready to execute the task yet.

Please refine your plan further, drawing on your expertise as MCP API Integrator to address any gaps or uncertainties. As you refine your plan, be specific about which available tools you will use, how you will use them, and why they are the best choices for each step. Clearly outline your tool usage strategy as part of your improved plan.

After refining your plan, assess whether you feel ready to execute the task. Conclude with one of these statements:

"READY: I am ready to execute the task."
"NOT READY: I need to refine my plan further because [specific reason]."
